## Fixed / Random Elements

When the game generates your Thing, the final enchantments may not always align with your expectations. This discrepancy is from certain factors: whether the Thing is an equipment, if it's unique, or other inherent properties. Some randomness is added into the generation process.

However, if you want your Thing to be generated with the exact elements specified in the **elements** column of your source sheet, you can add the tag **`fixedElement`**. This tag overrides the random generation aspects, guaranteeing that the exact elements you've listed will be applied.

Vice versa, you can use `randomElement` to ensure randomness is added in.
